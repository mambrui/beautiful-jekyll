My name is Gerardo Iglesias Galv&aacute;n. I am an Information Security consultant working as a freelancer. My areas of interest include penetration testing, reverse enegineering, malware analysis, vulnerability analysis and exploitation.

This will be just another guy's blog on random infosec topics, serving mainly as reference for myself, but hopefully somebody will find it useful and learn something new in the way.
